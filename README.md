# GradskiMuzejSubotica
Project for college diploma
A web application for working with the objects of the City Museum of Subotica 
was designed and implemented. The process was carried out using Larman's method. 
In the first phase, I defined the verbal model and use cases. In the second phase, 
sequential diagrams of use cases were created, and system contracts were defined, 
presenting the conceptual model and relational model. In the third phase, sequential 
and collaboration diagrams of system contracts, database tables, and user interfaces 
were displayed. The fourth phase was executed in C# using the ASP .NET MVC 
framework. The fifth phase (testing) was conducted as part of the defense of the 
diploma thesis
